Download a package 

open GitBush or cmd  (somewhere where you can change the current working directory to this project :D )
Type - node serverStore.js
Go to your browser
Type - localhost:3000/store.html 
(if this port is busy change the port in serverStore.js and type that port instead of 3000)
Done! I think yo can figure out how to use that 

WARNING!!!
there is a bug - if you type wrong ID it will give you an error in console 
I will fix that I promise :D
